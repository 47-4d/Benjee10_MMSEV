PLANETSIDE EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGIES
VERSION 1.0.0
for KERBAL SPACE PROGRAM 1.11.0+ BREAKING GROUND

Thanks you for downloading Planetside Exploration Technologies, a mod for KSP version 1.11.0+ by Benjee10.

Planetside Exploration Technologies adds a number of parts based on the NASA Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle, as well as an extensive set of modular surface base parts. Additionally, Planetside adds a new type of power source - wind turbines, which can be deployed on atmospheric bodies to generate ElectricCharge. Wind Turbines come in a number of types, specialised for different atmospheric conditions. Difficulty settings are provided for wind power.

INSTALLATION
Place the contents of the included GameData directory in your Kerbal Space Program/GameData directory. 
If updating this mod, pleases remove any previous versions before installing to prevent compatibility issues. 

DEPENDENCIES
Planetside requires B9PartSwitch, ModuleManager, HabTechProps, and bundles Benjee10_sharedAssets for additional parts. All of these are bundled with the download. 
The KSP BREAKING GROUND DLC is required for full functionality.
